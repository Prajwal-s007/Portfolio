						<p>In the majority of industries, artificial intelligence is used to boost productivity and improve 
						accuracy; nevertheless, when it comes to bargaining or negotiation, this technology has not yet 
						been fully explored and does not yet show its actual effectiveness. Negotiation or bargaining is 
						a skill that involves people interacting with one another in order to reach an agreement that is 
						better than the original price.</p>
						
						<p>It is done with the intention of benefiting both the seller and the 
						buyer, but occasionally buyers will reach an agreement without being aware of the market price 
						of the product. We are integrating ML algorithms (Random Forest, Decision tree, XGBoost, 
						Gaussian Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors) with Ensemble Techniques to further study the 
						topic of negotiation. These algorithms aid in forecasting the optimal price, and for negotiation, 
						we using Averaging for Discounting and doing what-if scenarios. We believe that this research 
						will lead to solutions and opportunities for innovation in the negotiating sector.</p>

	   					<h4>Telecom Churn Case Study</h4>
	   					<p>In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.</p>

<p>For many incumbent operators, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business goal.</p>


<p> To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.</p>

   <p> In this project, you will analyse customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn and identify the main indicators of churn.</p>

	   					<h4>House Price Prediction</h4>
	   					<p>A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The data is provided in the CSV file below. </p>


<p>The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not. </p>


<p> The company wants to know the following things about the prospective properties:</p>

   <p> i)Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and</p>
    <p> ii)How well those variables describe the price of a house.</p>
     <p> iIi)Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.</p>

	   					<p>A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.</p>

<p>In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.</p>


<p> The company wants to know factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market:</p>

   <p> i)Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.</p>
    <p> ii)How well those variables describe the bike demands.</p>

	   					<h4>Lead Scoring Case Study</h4>
	   					<p>An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. On any given day, many professionals who are interested in the courses land on their website and browse for courses. </p>

 

             <p>The company markets its courses on several websites and search engines like Google. Once these people land on the website, they might browse the courses or fill up a form for the course or watch some videos. When these people fill up a form providing their email address or phone number, they are classified to be a lead. Moreover, the company also gets leads through past referrals. Once these leads are acquired, employees from the sales team start making calls, writing emails, etc. Through this process, some of the leads get converted while most do not. The typical lead conversion rate at X education is around 30%.</p> 

              <p> Now, although X Education gets a lot of leads, its lead conversion rate is very poor. For example, if, say, they acquire 100 leads in a day, only about 30 of them are converted. To make this process more efficient, the company wishes to identify the most potential leads, also known as ‘Hot Leads’. If they successfully identify this set of leads, the lead conversion rate should go up as the sales team will now be focusing more on communicating with the potential leads rather than making calls to everyone.</p>

	   					<h4>Bank Credit Case Study</h4>
	   					<p>This case study aims to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their installments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.</p>

 

                                                  <p>In other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.</p>

                                                  <p>To develop your understanding of the domain, you are advised to independently research a little about risk analytics - understanding the types of variables and their significance should be enough).</p>

					      <h4>About this course</h4>
					      <p>I'm thrilled to announce that I have completed my Executive PG Programme in Data Science with specialization in Deep Learning at International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore. The programme has greatly aided my development of skills in the fields of machine learning and Data Science.
 
The most difficult aspect is learning while working. The deadlines were critical, but we made it with flying colours.
 
It was an incredible experience, and the course content was sufficient to lay a solid foundation for the individuals. Thanks to upGrad and the International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore for helping working people to become better versions of themselves.
